UserFrosting-master.zip contains the userfrosting version 0.2.2 . First step is to install userfrosting on your server. Steps are mentioned in their readme.
delete the install folder and make sure userfrosting is properly working on your system.
mydb.tar.gz contains the mongo dump.
userfrosting.sql contains the sql dump.
restore the sql and mongo databases.
now extract the UserFrosting-master.tar.gz file and copy this folder in place of the Userforsting-master folder currently on your server.
done.

NOTE: you would not need newfiles.tar.gz file. it is just for reference, the new files that we added to userfrosting. 
Thanks :).
